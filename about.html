				<p>Mariah Wilson is a third year student at Princeton University studying Visual Arts with an emphasis on film production and photography. As a young girl she fell in love with reading, which inspired her love for television and film. This love of the arts has transpired her love for writing.</p>

				<p>Mariah has written and directed many of her own short works. She has written over five complete projects ranging from short films to a television pilot. She has worked on a number of student productions participating in various roles from production assistant to writer/director. Her most recent film credits include assistant cinematographer and director, and her cinematographic work has been screened at the Garden Theater in Princeton, New Jersey. Her freshman year of college, she received the award for “Outstanding Work by an Underclassman” from the Creative Writing department.</p>

				<p>Mariah hopes to use her passion for television for more than just producing quality content, but she also intends to try and change the politics of gender representation in front of and behind the camera so viewership becomes a more enjoyable and inclusive pastime for all people. Some of her other disciplines and fields of interests include: comparative literature, computer science, photography, and video game art design/development.</p>
